# JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 6  

## What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding internal logic and showing only necessary functionality to the user.
In simple words, the user knows what to do, not how it is done.

---

## Why do we use Abstraction?
- To hide complex logic  
- To make code simple to use  
- To focus only on important actions  
- To improve code readability  

---

## Real Life Example
When we chat with each other, we do not know how the computer or internet works internally.  
We only know how to send and receive messages.  
This is abstraction.

---

## Example Learned Today
- User uses `startChat()` method  
- Internal logic like server connection is hidden  
- User only sees the final result  

---

## What I Learned Today
- Abstraction hides implementation logic  
- User interacts with simple methods  
- Internal code stays private  
- Abstraction makes code easy to use

Happy Coding ❤️
