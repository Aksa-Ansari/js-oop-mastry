# JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 5  
## Topic: Encapsulation + Getter & Setter

---

## What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means keeping important data hidden inside a class and allowing access only through specific methods. This keeps the data safe and gives us control over how it is used or changed.

---

## Why do we use Encapsulation?
- To protect data  
- To avoid direct changes  
- To control how values are read or updated  
- To write clean and secure code  
- To manage object data properly

## What are Getters & Setters?

### Getter  
Used to read private data.  
`get` is a JavaScript keyword.

### Setter  
Used to update private data.  
`set` is also a JavaScript keyword.
