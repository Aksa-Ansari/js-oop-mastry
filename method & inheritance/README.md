# 🚀 JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 3  
## Topics Covered:
- Methods  
- Inheritance (extends)  

---

## 1. What Are Methods?
Methods are functions written inside a class.  
They define what an object can do (its behavior).

For example:  
Mobile → call(), message()  
Car → start(), stop()

---

## 2. What is Inheritance?
Inheritance means one class can use the code of another class.  
We use the `extends` keyword for this.
It helps avoid repeating code and keeps the code clean.
