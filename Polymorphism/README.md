# JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 07  

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means **same method can have different behavior** in different classes, In simple words we can say One name, many forms.

---

## Why use Polymorphism?
- Reuse same method name  
- Different classes can have different behavior  
- Code stays clean and easy to read  

---

## Real Life Examples
- Mobile camera: click → selfie / normal photo / record video  
- Car: start → petrol car / electric car  
- Animal sounds: same `makeSound()` but different output  

---

## JavaScript Example
- Parent class `Animal` → `makeSound()` generic  
- Child class `Dog` → `makeSound()` = bark  
- Child class `Cat` → `makeSound()` = meow  

---

## What I Learned Today
- Same method, different behavior = Polymorphism  
- Method overriding in child classes  
- Real life examples make it easy to understand  
- Helps in writing clean & reusable code

Happy Coding ❤️
