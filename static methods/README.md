# 🚀 JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 08  

## What are Static Methods?
Static methods are methods that belong to the **class**, not to the object.

They can be called directly using the class name.

---

## Why do we use Static Methods?
- When method does not need object data  
- For utility or helper functions  
- To avoid unnecessary object creation  

---

## Important Points
- Static methods are called using class name  
- Object is not required  
- Constructor is not needed for static methods  

---

## Example Learned Today
- Calculator class  
- add() and multiply() methods are static  
- Methods are called directly using class name  

---

## What I Learned Today
- Static methods work at class level  
- They save memory by avoiding objects  
- Used for common logic and calculations
