# 🚀 JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 9

## What are Getters?
Getters are special methods used to **read or get a value** from an object.
They are accessed like a property, not like a function.

---

## What are Setters?
Setters are special methods used to **update or set a value**.
They help us add rules and validation before changing data.

---

## Why do we use Getters and Setters?
- To control access to data  
- To protect data from invalid values  
- To follow encapsulation principle  

---

## Example Used
- BankAccount class  
- Getter to read balance  
- Setter to update balance safely

## What I Learned Today
