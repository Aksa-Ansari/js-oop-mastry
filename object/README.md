## ⭐ What is an Object?
An object is a way to store information in JavaScript.
It keeps data in **key–value pairs**, like a real thing having details.
Each object can have **properties** (details) and **methods** (actions).

---

## Why we use it?
- To represent real-life things in code (like mobile, car, user).
- To keep related data together in one place.
- To make our code cleaner and easier to understand.
- To perform actions using methods.
- Used everywhere in professional development.

## Example
```js
let mobile = {
brand: "oppo",
color: "Blue",
price: 22000,
ring: function(){
return "Mobile is ringing.....";
}
}
