# JavaScript OOP — Day 2 (Classes, Constructor & this)
Today I learned the basics of Classes in JavaScript.  
This simple practice shows how classes work and how we use constructors and the `this` keyword.

---

## What is a Class?
A **class** is a blueprint/template for creating objects.

Example:
- Class → Car ka design
- Object → BMW, Audi (actual cars)

---

## What is a Constructor?
Constructor ek special method hota hai jo object bante hi automatically run hota hai.  
Iska kaam hota hai object ko starting values dena.

---

## What is this keyword?
`this` hamesha current object ko point karta hai.  
Jis object par method call hota hai, `this` usi ko refer karta hai.
