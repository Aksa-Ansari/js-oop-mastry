# 🚀 JavaScript OOP Journey – Day 10  
## Topic: Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance

---

## ⭐ What is Prototype?
Prototype is a place where JavaScript stores **common methods**.
When an object does not find a method in itself, JavaScript looks into its prototype.

---

## ⭐ Why Prototype is Used?
- To share methods between objects  
- To save memory  
- To avoid duplicate code  

---

## ⭐ Prototypal Inheritance
Prototypal inheritance means one object can **access properties or methods of another object**.

JavaScript uses prototype chain to do this.

---

## ⭐ What I Learned Today
- Objects can use methods from prototype  
- JavaScript checks prototype if method is not found  
- Object.create() is used for inheritance

Happy Learning ❤️
